# Doctrine based DBAL for Nova Framework

To use this Nova Package you should copy the directory **DBAL** into **app/Packages** and to add on your **composer.json** the following:

```
    "require": {
        "doctrine/dbal": "2.5.*",
    },
```

Finally, update your Composer Packages, to import the Doctrine DBAL, then you can start to use your new **DBAL**.
